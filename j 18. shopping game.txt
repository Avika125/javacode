Aayush can purchase at most M smartphones and Harshit can purchase at most N smartphones. Who will win ? Print "Aayush" and "Harshit" accordingly.

Input Format
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Two integers M and N denoting the maximum possible number of smartphones Aayush and Harshit can purchase respectively.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ M, N ≤ 10^6

Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing one string — the name of the winner i.e. Aayush or Harshit
